# Political Structure

## General
- **Constitution**: The server has a constitution that outlines the fundamental regulations of the server.
- **Elections**: Citizens can vote in regular elections to elect the President or Senators.
- **Head of Server**: The head of server has the power to introduce/veto bills and appoint the moderation team.
- **Moderation Team**: The moderation team detects and punish unlawful behavior.
- **Court**: It can counteract moderation decisions as well as interpret the constitution.
- **Citizens**: Citizens are members of the server who can vote in elections and raise petitions.
- **Undocumented members**: They function as regular citizens without political rights. However, they can apply for citizenship and can appeal moderation decisions to the court.

However, the two systems differ in the following ways:
- In a presidential system, the President is the nominal head of the server, while in a parliamentry system, the Prime Minister is the nominal head of the server.
- In a presidential system, the President is directly elected by the citizens, while in a parliamentry system, the Prime Minister is appointed by the Senate. Instead, senators are elected by the citizens.
- In a presidential system, the President appoints judges to the court, while in a parliamentry system, the Prime Minister nominates judges to the court, who are then affirmed by the Senate.

## Special Features
- In the presidential system, citizens may override court interpretation of the constitution through a referendum.
