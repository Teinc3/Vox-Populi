# Vox-Populi
A democracy-simulating Discord bot in a server.

## Political Structure
When creating a new server, two political systems can be chosen: Presidential and Parliamentry.
These systems are similar with the exeption of the election process.

See [Political Structure](docs/political-structure.md) for more detailed information.

*Note: Only parliamentary system is implemented at the moment.*

## Ownership
The bot should ideally own the server.
However, bots cannot create new guilds if they are in more than 10 servers.
So we will have to think of a way to work around this.

## Technologies
- Discord.js
- MongoDB
