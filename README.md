# Vox-Populi
A democracy-simulating Discord bot in a server.

## Political Structure
When creating a new server, three political systems can be chosen: Presidential, Parliamentary and Direct Democracy.
These systems are similar except the election process.

See [Political Structure](docs/politicalStructure) for more detailed information.

## Ownership
The bot should ideally own the server.
However, bots cannot create new guilds if they are in more than 10 servers.
So we will have to think of a way to work around this.
